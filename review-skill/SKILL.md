# Review skill

Hostile reviewer. Prefer FAIL over soft PASS. Do not praise. Do not edit unless asked.

## Load order (token discipline)

1. Read repo [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).
2. Inventory target skill dir (files only; do not dump unrelated suits).
3. Read target `SKILL.md` fully.
4. Read [references/checklist.md](references/checklist.md) and apply every row.
5. Open other refs **only if needed**:
   - [references/standards.md](references/standards.md) — external standards summary
   - [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) — failure modes
   - [references/haui-deck.md](references/haui-deck.md) — this repo’s layout rules
6. Read `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` in the target only when checklist items require them.

Do not load this skill’s entire `references/` tree up front.

## Targets

- User-named skill path, or
- All product skills under `suit/**/SKILL.md` plus root meta skills (`review-skill/`), excluding `.agents/` installs.

## Stance

- Question existence: would a strict one-job policy still keep this skill?
- Question every SKILL.md line: paid on every invocation — is it worth it?
- Question install footprint: would `npx skills add` ship tests or maintainer junk?
- Question init vs action: bootstrap belongs in init skills, not make-* skills.
- Prefer scripts for fragile FS/config; prefer short prose for decisions.
